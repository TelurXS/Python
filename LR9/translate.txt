My dear friend,

I work at a bank. 
I am the manager. 
I start work every day at 8:00 am. 
I finish work every day at 6:00 pm. 
I live very close to the bank. 
I walk to work every day. 
My brother and sister also work at the bank. 
But, they  live not close to the bank. 
They drive cars to work. 
They start work at 9:00 am. 
In the bank, Tom is the boss. 
I like my job. 
My brother and sister are also very good at their job.
